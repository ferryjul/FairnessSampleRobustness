This repository contains the code to reproduce our experiments for the paper "Improving fairness generalization through a sample-robust optimization method" (Machine Learning journal).

Folder `FairCORELS_Exact` contains code to reproduce all experiments using FairCORELS (Section 4.1) with our exact (MIP-based) method and generate the presented Figures.

Folder `FairCORELS_Heuristic` contains code to reproduce all experiments using FairCORELS (Section 4.1) with our heuristic (masks-based) method and generate the presented Figures.

Folder `TFCO_Heuristic` contains code to reproduce all experiments using the TensorFlow Constrained Optimization library (Section 4.2) and generate the presented Tables.

Each folder contains a `README.md` file explaining how to launch the experiments and how to generate the Figures.
